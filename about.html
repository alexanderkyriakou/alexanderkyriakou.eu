<p>Go online to explore, have fun and enrich yourself. That should be the purpose, and not to get enraged on futile matters or dull your senses with meaningless content.</p>

<p>In this space, will attempt a harmonic blend of various elements that outline my experiences.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>

<h2>Personal background</h2>
<p>Born in July 1992 in Ukraine as Bilyk Alexander, and raised in a small village two hours out of Kiev. By age 9, I was living in Athens, Greece. Few weird and out-of-place years later,
  ended up studying <i>Information Management</i> at International Hellenic University (formely TEI Kavalas), from where I graduated officially in 2016. 'Officially', cause 
  everything was completed by 2014, but changing the thesis subject three times, didn't help speed up things. I have been a permanent resident of Athens since 2014, 
  and earlier that year I adopted the name Alexander Kyriakou.</p>

<p>Throughout the years cultivated the habit of learning and being curious about the world, answering self-questioned whys and hows. A habit which I hope will keep alive and 
  for the years to come.</p>
  
<p>So far, I've realized about myself that I enjoy being around animals, doing physical activities in nature and exploring anything beautiful the world has to offer. Music, still, or moving
  pictures, written thoughts and ideas. I like to think that I'm a lifelong learner, figuring out ways that tomorrow's self will be proud of the past.</p>

<p>I'm a big fan of technology and its potential to improve our lives. In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with the digital world, learn new skills, and stay up-to-date with the 
  technological news. Overall, I strive to live a balanced life, combining my passions and interests with my professional goals and aspirations.</p>

<h3>Professional work-life</h3>
<p>My first experience in a work environment was as intern in the HR department of university, followed after a while as a production assistat 
  in an event management company. In parallel I was working as a technical support to local pharmacies and doctor offices, which was quite interesting.
  Around late 2017 started working in a language center in Piraeus as a Moodle developer, where had the opportunity to create the 
  <a href="http://fastschool.eu/elearning/" target="_blank">fastschool English elearning platform</a>. After a year or so, started teaching
computer skills to adults in order to obtain the ECDL certificate, an interesting experience as well.</p>

<p>In 2019 served in the Greek army, was stationed in the beautiful Nisyros island and 
  was part of the 2nd and 3rd office. Contrary to popular belief, the army experience was quite positive, met interesting people and learned a lot about myself.</p>
</p>

<p>In late 2019 and early 2020, stopped teaching computer skills as I wanted to focus more on developing elearning platforms and courses, which attempt sadly 
  didn't materialize. Tinkering with web development existed always in the back of my mind, thus started looking into other positions that these skills could be applied. Without being 
  dedicated front-end / back-end developer, as didn't feel that it's something I would like to do full-time. In the beginning of 2020 joined the GIM Agency as a SEO Specialist, 
  after discovering that there's a gap in the market for people that can combine technical skills with marketing. Learned the basics of SEO and marketing in a week and thankfully got hired. 
  Worked there for 2 years, at that time had my first corporate experience. Learned a lot about SEO, marketing, project management, client handling and various other skills.</p>

  <p>After a while felt stagnant and a strong feeling of wanting to develop myself professionally, resulting joining Relevance where I focused on Technical SEO and extensive audits. Few months in, 
  natural progress of things, dived more into Analytics and Visualization. It was a year filled with projects from multiple sectors and a big variety of websites of all sizes. 
  An intense and quite interesting year, which unfortunately had to come to an end cause of eventful intra-company dynamics. Stayed out of the corporate world for a year, keeping up with personal life, 
  readings, and skilling-up on analytics towards BI.</p>
  
  <p>In September of 2024 joined Ferryscanner, as in-house SEO Project Manager/Owner. A position which jokingly with colleagues from the agencies, would fit me 
  like a glove, cause then I'd be free to go as much in depth needed and required, which is actually true. The whole product is getting reworked properly with the bots in mind and everything revolving 
  around the end user. Many challenges, including progressive adoption of quality fundamentals and overall acknowledgment of end-user's needs. Still, work in progress.</p>

  <p>May the future be prosperous and worth looking forward to.</p>


<h3>Platforms where I'm <i>semi</i>-active</h3>

<p>Will reduce quite a bit the time for "research".</p>

<h2>Purpose of alexanderkyriakou.eu</h2>
<p>In short: motivate and inspire.</p>

<p>I want to materialize some technical ideas, and express them in an unconfined way through <a href="/thoughts.html" target="_blank">thoughts</a>. 
In a sense, to stop being a passive consumer of information, and start creating.
Through this process I aim to learn, challenge and explore - hope some of the readers will find it useful too.</p>

<p>But, but - Alex you can spew pages with a few prompts, why you're not doing that? We're not in the 90s anymore. Yes, but where's the fun in that?</p>

<p>My goal is to develop this website to a mix of blog and portfolio, simple as possible without any unnecessary clutter, while providing a calming digital experience.
  Everything is handcrafted, from the code to the content. Might be naive, but I want to keep it this way (parts that are generated, will be disclaimed). 
  I aim not to reinvent the wheel, but to create my own one.</p>

<p>The .eu domain was chosen to reflect my support for life in the European Union.</p>

<h3>Future plans</h3>
<p>Some initial ideas for the website are as follows, obviously subject to change. Hope I'll stick to them, without extreme delays.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mini projects - tools</li>
  <li>Playing with frameworks</li>
  <li>Implementing an OS CMS or a custom one</li>
  <li>Optimizing existing approaches</li>
  <li>Fixing various present bugs</li>
  <li>More correct use of HTML & CSS</li>
  <li>Better informational structure</li>
  <li>Local hosting</li>
  <li>Pages in Greek</li>
  <li>Dark mode</li>
  <li>Give it a 'character', and many more fun things to come</li>
</ul>
